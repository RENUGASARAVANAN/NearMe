Virupaksha cave is one of the ancient caves in India with its history dating back to the 13th century.The cave is located on the 
eastern slopes of the Arunachala Hill.The history of the cave dates back to the time when it was the abode of sage Virupaksha 
Deva.It later gained importance after Sri Ramana Maharshi stayed in the cave for 16 years.The cave derives its name from
Virupaksha Deva,who was a renowned 13th century saint.It is believed that siant Viruapaksha spent most of his life in this
cave and its surroundings.It is also that his body turned into ashes just after his Samadhi(a state of complete oneness).The
holy ash is supposed to be preserved here on the altar.
