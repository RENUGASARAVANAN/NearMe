Each of the spiritual centers of india has its oown character and line of tradition.Among them all it is Tiruvannamalai
(Arunachala) represents the most direct,the most formless and the least rituelistic of paths,the path of self-
enquiry,whose gateway is silent initiation.This is expressed in the old Tamil saying:"To see Chidambaram,to be born at
Tiruvarur,to die at Banaras or even to think of Arunachala is to be assured of Liberation.""Even to think of" because
in the case of the path physical contact is not necessary.Hence,it was no accident that the Maharshi made 
Tiruvannamalai and its sacred Arunachala Mountain his home.The Maharshi called Arunachala the spiritual Heart of the world.
